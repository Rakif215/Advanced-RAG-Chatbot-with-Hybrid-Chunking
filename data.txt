## Advanced Chunking Techniques for RAG Chatbots

This document explores advanced chunking techniques crucial for building effective Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbots.  Proper chunking significantly impacts information retrieval and the quality of chatbot responses.

### Traditional vs. Advanced Chunking

Traditional methods (fixed chunk sizes, paragraph splits) often fall short.  They can break sentences, separate related ideas, and lead to poor retrieval.  Advanced techniques, as demonstrated here, address these limitations.

### Chunking Strategies Implemented

#### 1. Combined Character and Recursive Splitting

We combine these for an initial text breakdown:

*   **Character Splitter:** Divides text into fixed-length chunks.  Useful for initial processing.
*   **Recursive Splitter:**  Recursively splits based on separators (`\n\n`, `\n`, ` `), attempting to keep sentences and paragraphs intact. This provides a good balance between chunk size and semantic coherence.

#### 2. Specialized Splitters for Structured Content

These handle specific document formats:

*   **Markdown Splitter:**  Parses Markdown syntax, splitting by headings, lists, etc. This maintains logical document structure.  Example:

```markdown
# My Markdown Document

## Section 1

This is some text.
